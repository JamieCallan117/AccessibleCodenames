    <string name="teams_help">Each team consists of a minimum of 2 players.\n\nOne player per team must be the spymaster, whilst all other players will be guessers.\n\nTeams should be similarly balanced, so a team should have at most 1 player more than the other.</string>
    <string name="spymaster_help">As the spymaster, you are able to see what type every square on the board is, you must use this information to help your team select the words associated with your teams colour.\n\nYou are only able to communicate with the rest of your team by a single word, followed by a number. This is your hint.\n\nThe word part of your hint should relate to as many of your teams words as possible. So if \'Student\' and \'Exam\' were two of your words, you could give the hint \'University\'. The number is then how many words relate to the hint you\'ve given.\n\nYou may also give the numbers \'0\' or infinity. 0 means that no words relate to the word hint you gave, and infinity allows your team to guess as many words as they want, with the cost of not knowing how many words relate to the current word hint.</string>
    <string name="hints_help">Not anything can be used as a hint. The most basic rule is that the hint must be a single alphabetical word. No numbers or symbols can be used as a hint.\n\nThe hint may also not be a substring of any of the words on the board.\n\nFor example, if \'Flashlight\' is on the board, you cannot give the hint \'Flash\'.</string>
    <string name="guessing_help">For the non-spymasters, your job is to wait until the spymaster gives a hint, and then using that hint, guess what words on the board relate to that hint.\n\nThe hint will contain a word and a number, the word is used to find relating words on the board and the number is how many words relate to the hint.\n\nFor example, if you are given the hint \'Pirate, 2\', then you know that you have 2 words relating to the theme \'Pirate\'.\n\nThe number given also influences how many words you are able to guess. You are able to guess 1 more word than the number given in the hint. However, if given infinity you can guess as many times as you want, but remember that guessing an incorrect word will end your turn.</string>
    <string name="squares_help">A board contains 25 different squares. A game with default rules will have 9 squares for Team A, 8 squares for Team B, 7 Neutral squares and 1 Bomb square.\n\nClicking a square for your own team is fine, but clicking one for the opposing team will end your teams turn whilst also meaning that team has 1 less word to find.\n\nClicking a neutral world, will simply end your teams turn.\n\nClicking the bomb word will instantly end the game, and the team who clicked it will lose.</string>
    <string name="playing_help">Once each team has at least 2 members each, the game can begin. For a default game, Team A will start as they have 1 more word to guess than Team B. Team A\'s spymaster must give a hint, then the other members of Team A must guess their words. Their turn can be ended manually, or by finding all plus 1 of the words relating to their hint, or by selecting an incorrect word.\n\nNext comes Team B\'s turn, this will be identical to Team A\'s turn in structure, but relating to Team B instead.\n\nThis will repeat back and forth until a winner is decided.\n\nTo win the game, your team must successfully find all of the words for your team. You may also win by having the opposing team select the bomb word.</string>

# Accessible Codenames | Swansea University Third Year Project

The topic of my final year project was "Accessible Games", where I had to take an existing game and create an accessible version of the game. For this project, I chose to re-create the game Codenames.

## Menus

The menus to navigate through the app are fairly basic. There's a main menu, a settings menu and menus for creating/joining games. The settings menu allows you to adjust the music and sound effects volume and also toggle text-to-speech. Here you can also go to the colour options menu where you can change the colours of different elements in the app.

## Playing the Game

The app features 2 ways to play. You can play locally which replaces the board game version of the game by passing around the device based on the current turn in-game. The other mode is an online mode where each player plays on their own device. You can either join a public room or create a private room with a password to play with just friends.

## Accessibility

The app features 2 accessibility features, one is text-to-speech by performing a held press action on any element in the app featuring text such as buttons or titles. Some pieces of text are automatically read aloud.
The other is the ability to change the colour of elements in the app such as what colour represents each team or the background colour of the app.
